## 1. ReactiveSearch: Intro

ReactiveSearch is an Elasticsearch UI components library for React and React Native. It has 25+ components consisting of Lists, Ranges, Search UIs, Result displays and a way to bring any existing UI component into the library.

The library is conceptually divided into two parts:  

1. Sensor components and
2. Actuator components.

Each sensor component is built for applying a specific filter on the data. For example:

* A [`SingleList`](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/list-components/singlelist.html) sensor component applies an exact match filter based on the selected item.
* A [`RangeSlider`](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/range-components/rangeslider.html) component applies a numeric range query based on the values selected from the UI.
* A [`DataSearch`](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/search-components/datasearch.html) component applies a suggestions and search query based on the search term typed by the user.

Sensor components can be configured to create a combined query context and render the matching results via an actuator component.

**ReactiveSearch** primarily comes with two actuators: `ResultCard` and `ResultList`. ResultCard displays the results in a card interface whereas ResultList displays them in a list. Both provide built-in support for pagination and infinite scroll views. Besides these, the library also provides low level actuators (ReactiveComponent and ReactiveList) to render in a more customized fashion.

<br />

## 2. Features

### Design

* The sensor / actuator design pattern allows creating complex UIs where any number of sensors can be chained together to reactively update an actuator (or even multiple actuators).
* The library handles the transformation of the UI interactions into database queries. You only need to include the components and associate each with a DB field.
* Built in live updates - Actuators can be set to update results even when the underlying data changes in the DB.
* Comes with scoped and styled components. Doesn't require any external CSS library import, comes with className and innerClass support.
* Is themable via [`ThemeProvider`](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/theming/themes.html).

### Ease of Use

* One step installation with [npm i @appbaseio/reactivesearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/v1/getting-started/reactivesearch.html),
* A UMD build that works directly in the browser. Installation steps [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/reactivesearch.html#reactivesearch-as-umd),
* Styled and scoped components that can be easily extended,
* See the [reactivesearch starter app](https://github.com/appbaseio-apps/reactivesearch-starter-app).

* If you're using reactivesearch for web

```javascript
npm install @appbaseio/reactivesearch
```

You can check out the quickstart guide with React [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/reactivesearch.html).

* If you're using reactivesearch for mobile (native)

```javascript
npm install @appbaseio/reactivesearch-native
```

You can check out the quickstart guide with React Native [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/native/getting-started/reactivesearch.html).
