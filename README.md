## 1. ReactiveSearch: Intro

ReactiveSearch is a UI components library for React and Vue, designed to work with ReactiveSearch cloud. It has over 20 UI components consisting of Lists, Ranges, Search UIs, Result displays, AI Answer, Charts, and a way to bring an existing UI component into the library.

A UI component can be used for filtering or searching on the index. For example:

-   A [`SingleList`](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/list/singlelist/) sensor component applies an exact match filter based on the selected item.
-   A [`RangeSlider`](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/range/rangeslider/) component applies a numeric range query based on the values selected from the UI.
-   A [`SearchBox`](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/search/searchbox/) component applies a suggestions and search query based on the search term typed by the user.

UI components can be used together (`react` prop allows configuring this on a per-component level) and render the matching results via a result display UI component.

**ReactiveSearch** supports the following built-in display components for displaying results (aka hits):
1. [ReactiveList](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/result/reactivelist/) - ReactiveList supports list and card display formats as well as allows custom rendering at both item and component level,
2. [ReactiveMap](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/map/reactivegooglemap/) - ReactiveMap offers choice of Google Maps and OpenStreetMaps for map rendering,
3. [AIAnswer](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/search/aianswer/) - AIAnswer offers Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) via search engine and OpenAI models, and
4. [ReactiveChart](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/chart/reactivechart/) - Powered by Apache E-Charts, ReactiveChart offers 5 built-in chart types: pie, bar, histogram, line, scatter, and additional charts in the Apache E-Charts format. ReactiveChart is only supported for React at this time.


<br />

## 2. Features

### Design

-   The UI components's query generation and ability to `react` allows for creating complex UIs where a number of UI components can reactively update based on user interaction.
-   The library handles the transformation of the UI interactions into search intent queries.
-   Comes with scoped and styled components with `className`` and `innerClass` prop support.
-   Is themable via [`ThemeProvider`](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/theming/overview/).

### Ease of Use

-   One step installation with [npm i @appbaseio/reactivesearch](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/reactivesearch/react/overview/quickstart/),
-   Styled and scoped components that can be easily extended,
-   See the [reactivesearch starter app](https://github.com/awesome-reactivesearch/reactivesearch-starter-app).

### ðŸ†• ReactiveSearch API: Secure your Search Queries

Starting ReactiveSearch v4 (current major release), the library only sends the search intent, specification for this is here - [ReactiveSearch API ref](https://docs.reactivesearch.io/docs/search/reactivesearch-api/). Based on the choice of search engine you configure in ReactiveSearch cloud, the search query DSL is then generated by ReactiveSearch cloud. This approach is both more secure as well as allows transfering the search business logic on the server-side.


If you're using ReactiveSearch v3 (last major release), use of ReactiveSearch API over ElasticSearch's query DSL is an opt-in feature. You need to set the `enableAppbase` prop as `true` in your `ReactiveBase` component. This assumes that you are using appbase.io for your backend.

We recommend checking out this [KitchenSink App](https://codesandbox.io/s/loving-margulis-p8rd6z) that demonstrates the use of the `ReactiveSearch API` for all the ReactiveSearch components.

## 3. Component Playground

Try the live component playground stories at [playground](https://opensource.appbase.io/playground/?filterBy=ReactiveSearch&selectedKind=Range%20components%2FRatingsFilter). Look out for the knobs section in the playground part of the stories to tweak each prop and see the effects.

<br />

## 4. Live Demos

A set of live demos inspired by real world apps, built with ReactiveSearch.

### Web

-  [demos/booksearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/goodbooks/) - An book search app based on a goodbooks dataset.
- [BookSearch with Antd](https://antd-booksearch.reactiveapps.io/) - A demo showing use of Ant design's theming and UI components with ReactiveSearch
- [E-commerce Movie Search](https://movies-ecommerce-demo.reactiveapps.io/) - A demo showing an e-commerce movie search UI
- [Dashboard search and charts](https://dashboard-app.reactiveapps.io/) - A demo with user authentication: login, search and charts UIs.
