ReactiveSearch Native is built on the same philosophy as [ReactiveSearch for web](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/). It shares the same advanced concepts. A list of guides are mentioned below which are common for both the web and native version.

### Custom Queries

ReactiveSearch components come with default Elasticsearch queries. In case you wish to use your own custom queries, the filter components provide a `customQuery` prop. Check the detailed guide [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/customquery/).

### React prop

One of the key ideas behind ReactiveSearch is the reactive design pattern, which allows defining how a component reacts to changes in the states of other components. This is acheived by the `react` prop supported by ReactiveSearch components. Check the detailed guide [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/react/).

### Writing and Editing Data

ReactiveSearch components are great for reading data, but at times you might want to create, update or delete your data. [Here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/writingdata/) is a detailed guide on performing write operations.

### Comparison with Other Projects

We've a detailed comparison of ReactiveSearch with other projects with similar aims [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/comparison/). Contributions are welcome!
