### Data Aware UI components

One of the key ideas behind Reactive Search and Reactive Maps is the abstraction of a query interface.

The UI components are already associated with the data queries. For instance,

-   **SingleList** and **MultiList** components create a exact term match query based on the selected items.
-   A **RangeSlider** component creates a numeric range query based on the selected `start` and `end` values.

Components rely on the `dataField` prop for selecting the database field on which the query needs to be applied.

However, there are cases where you would wish to override the associated query with your own.

### When to use Custom Query

`customQuery` is used to change the component's behavior for its subscribers. It gets triggered after an interaction on the component. Every component is shipped with a default behavior i.e. selecting a city on the SingleList component generates a term query. If you wish to change this behavior i.e. maybe perform additional query besides `term` query or do something else altogether, you can use `customQuery` prop.

```js
:customQuery = `() => ({
    query: {
        term: {
                user : "Kimchy"
            }
        }
    })
`
```

### Defining a Custom Query

Each component has a `customQuery` prop that accepts a function. The function can return an object in which you can define a `query` key(to modify the actual query) along with the query options(to add the query options in the query generated by ReactiveSearch) compatible with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.4/query-dsl.html" target="_blank">Elasticsearch Query DSL</a>. Here is a simple query object that applies a match query.

```javascript
<template>
  <data-search
   :customQuery="customQuery"
   ...
  />
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "app",
    methods: {
      customQuery() {
        return {
          "query": {
            "match": { "fieldName": "text to match" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Here is another example that applies a `match_phrase_prefix` query.

```javascript
<template>
  <data-search
   :customQuery="customQuery"
   ...
  />
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "app",
    methods: {
      customQuery() {
        return {
          "query": {
            "match_phrase_prefix": {
              "fieldName": {
                "query": "hello world",
                "max_expansions": 10
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

You can also define the query options in custom query:

```javascript
<template>
  <data-search
   :customQuery="customQuery"
   ...
  />
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "app",
    methods: {
      customQuery() {
        return {
          "timeout": "1s",
          "query": {
            "match_phrase_prefix": {
              "fieldName": {
                "query": "hello world",
                "max_expansions": 10
              }
            }
          },
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

### When to use Default Query

`defaultQuery` is ideally used with data-driven components to impact their own data.

For example, in a `SingleList` component showing list of cities you may only want to render cities belonging to India.

```js
:defaultQuery = `() => ({
        query: {
            terms: {
                country: [ "India" ]
            }
        }
    }
})`
```

### Defining a Default Query

Some components have a `defaultQuery` prop that accepts a function which has the same specifications as `customQuery`.DefaultQuery is used to apply the query on the source component. Unlike `customQuery`, It doesn't get leaked to other components. It's as if you create an internal component and apply the defaultQuery on it. Ideally, you would use this with components that are data-driven.

```javascript
<template>
  <single-list
   :defaultQuery="defaultQuery"
   ...
  />
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "app",
    methods: {
      defaultQuery() {
        return {
           "query": {
              "terms": {
                  "country": [ "India" ]
              }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

You can also define the query options in custom query:

```javascript
<template>
  <single-list
   :defaultQuery="defaultQuery"
   ...
  />
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: "app",
    methods: {
      defaultQuery() {
        return {
          "timeout": "1s",
          "query": {
              "terms": {
                  "country": [ "India" ]
              }
          },
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

### Not familiar to Elasticsearch?

You need to write a custom query but haven't worked with Elasticsearch. Okay, as a super quick primer, Elasticsearch is a data store search engine with a NoSQL JSON data model.

The docs link above is a good way to explore ElasticSearch in depth. Another alternative to get started with the query syntax is [Mirage](https://opensource.appbase.io/mirage), a GUI for composing Elasticsearch queries.
