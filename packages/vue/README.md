## Installation

## Documentation

The official docs for the library are at [https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/vue-web/getting-started/reactivesearch.html](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual).

The components are divided into four sections:

- List based UI components are at [reactive-manual/list-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/vue-web/list-components/singlelist.html).
- Range based UI components are at [reactive-manual/range-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/vue-web/range-components/singlerange.html).
- Search UI components are at [reactive-manual/search-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/vue-web/search-components/datasearch.html).
- Result components are at [reactive-manual/result-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/vue-web/result-components/resultlist.html).

## Related tooling and projects

- [**ReactiveSearch Dashboard**](https://dashboard.appbase.io/reactivesearch/) All your Reactive Search related apps (created via interactive tutorial, shared by others, etc.) can be accessed from here.
- [**ReactiveMaps**](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivemaps) is a similar project to Reactive Search that allows building realtime maps easily.

- [**appbase-js**](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) While building search UIs is dandy with Reactive Search, you might also need to add some input forms. **appbase-js** comes in handy there.

- [**dejavu**](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu) allows viewing raw data within an appbase.io (or Elasticsearch) app. **Soon to be released feature:** An ability to import custom data from CSV and JSON files, along with a guided walkthrough on applying data mappings.

- [**mirage**](https://github.com/appbaseio/mirage) ReactiveSearch components can be extended using custom Elasticsearch queries. For those new to Elasticsearch, Mirage provides an intuitive GUI for composing queries.
