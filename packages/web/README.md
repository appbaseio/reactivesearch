## Installation

```
yarn add @appbaseio/reactivesearch
```

## Concepts

The library is conceptually divided into two parts:

**1. Sensor components**

Each sensor component is purpose built for applying a specific filter on the data. For example: Rendering a Radio UI elements list based on the available dataset - [SingleList](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/list-components/singlelist.html)

**2. Actuator components**

Actuators represent the result UI view components. ReactiveSearch primarily comes with two actuators: `ResultCard` and `ResultList`.

ResultCard displays the results in a card interface whereas ResultList displays them in a list. Both provide built-in support for pagination and infinite scroll views. Besides these, the library also provides low level actuators (ReactiveComponent and ReactiveList) to render in a more customized fashion.

## Live Demos

A set of live demos inspired by real world apps, built with ReactiveSearch.

-   [demos/airbeds](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/airbeds/) - An airbnb-like booking search experience.
-   [demos/technews](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/technews/) - A full-text search app on the Hacker News dataset.
-   [demos/gitxplore](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/gitxplore/) - Explore all the popular Github repositories.
-   [demos/productsearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/producthunt/) - Filtered feed of products based on a small Product Hunt dataset.
-   [demos/booksearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/goodbooks/) - An book search app based on a goodbooks dataset.
-   [demos/ecommerce](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch/demos/ecommerce/) - An e-commerce car store app.

## Documentation

The official docs for the library are at [https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual).

The components are divided into four sections:

-   Generic UI components are at [reactive-manual/base-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/base-components/selectedfilters.html).
-   List based UI components are at [reactive-manual/list-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/list-components/singlelist.html).
-   Range based UI components are at [reactive-manual/range-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/range-components/singlerange.html).
-   Search UI components are at [reactive-manual/search-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/search-components/datasearch.html).
-   Result components are at [reactive-manual/result-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/result-components/resultlist.html).

## Related tooling and projects

-   [**ReactiveSearch Dashboard**](https://dashboard.appbase.io/reactivesearch/) All your Reactive Search related apps (created via interactive tutorial, shared by others, etc.) can be accessed from here.
-   [**ReactiveMaps**](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivemaps) is a similar project to Reactive Search that allows building realtime maps easily.

-   [**appbase-js**](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) While building search UIs is dandy with Reactive Search, you might also need to add some input forms. **appbase-js** comes in handy there.

-   [**dejavu**](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu) allows viewing raw data within an appbase.io (or Elasticsearch) app. **Soon to be released feature:** An ability to import custom data from CSV and JSON files, along with a guided walkthrough on applying data mappings.

-   [**mirage**](https://github.com/appbaseio/mirage) ReactiveSearch components can be extended using custom Elasticsearch queries. For those new to Elasticsearch, Mirage provides an intuitive GUI for composing queries.
